Todos:

1. Update read me following bug fixes.
<strike>2. Gallery search is not clearing upon unnsuccessful response - No entries found for category and state not emptying gallery/modal container or giving user feedback that there were no entries found for those searches.</strike>
3. Take another look at the widget behavior - widget not functioning in the correct order with the rest of the submission form.
4. Might be some other missing input validation.
5. Add Instagram button to modal.


Update: Removed blank targets on links that opened up new windows. 


Brief rundown of this project: - A simple gallery/artwork submission idea to allow people to connect with local artists with a selection of mediums to choose from, and for those local artists to submit their work to be viewed. 

MySQL was used for the database and a cloudinary widget was used for image uploads and image url creation for the database.
Other tech used - handlebars.js, jquery, GreenSock(GSAP), node and express.
