Todos:

1. Update read me following bug fixes.
<strike>2. Gallery search is not clearing upon unnsuccessful response - No entries found for category and state not emptying gallery/modal container or giving user feedback that there were no entries found for those searches.</strike>
3. Take another look at the widget behavior - widget not functioning in the correct order with the rest of the submission form.
4. Might be some other missing input validation.
5. Update: Removed blank targets on links that opened up new windows.
